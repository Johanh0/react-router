# React Router App

This project demonstrates the use of React Router to manage navigation in a React application.

## About React Router

React Router is a library that enables dynamic routing in React applications. It allows components to be rendered based on the URL, enabling a seamless navigation experience without full page reloads.

### Key Features:

- **Declarative Routing**: Routes are defined using JSX, making them easy to manage.
- **Dynamic Route Matching**: Supports URL parameters and nested routes.
- **Navigation Without Reloads**: Uses the browser history API for smooth navigation.

## How It Works in This Project

- `BrowserRouter` is used to wrap the application, enabling routing functionality.
- `Routes` and `Route` define different pages/components based on the URL.
- `NavLink` allow navigation between different views without reloading the page.

This implementation ensures a modern and user-friendly navigation experience in a React application.
